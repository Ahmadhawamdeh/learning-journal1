# JavaScript
*This book explains how JavaScript can be used
in browsers to make websites more interactive,
interesting, and user-friendly. You will also learn about
jQuery because it makes writing JavaScript a lot easier*

--------------
Being able to change the content of an HTML page while it is loaded in
the browser is very powerful. The examples below rely on the ability to: 
1. Access the content of the page 
1. Modify the content of the page 
1. Program rules or instructions the browser can follow 
1. React to events triggered by the user or browser

**WRITING A SCRIPT**

To write a script, you need to first
state your goal and then list the
tasks that need to be completed in
order to achieve it.
Humans can achieve complex goals without thinking
about them too much, for example you might be
able to drive a car, cook breakfast, or send an email
without a set of detailed instructions. But the first
time we do these things they can seem daunting.
Therefore, when learning a new skill, we often break
it down into smaller tasks, and learn one of these at
a time. With experience these individual tasks grow
familiar and seem simpler.

# EXPRESSIONS 
*An expression evaluates into (results in) a single value. Broadly speaking there are two types of expressions*
1. EXPRESSIONS THAT JUST ASSIGN A VALUE TO A VARIABLE In order for a variable to be useful, it needs to be
given a value. As you have seen, this is done using the assignment operator (the equals sign). 
1. EXPRESSIONS THAT USE TWO OR MORE VALUES TO RETURN A SINGLE VALUE You can perform operations on any number of individual values (see next page)

# Functions

*Browsers require very detailed instructions about what
we want them to do. Therefore, complex scripts can run
to hundreds (even thousands) of lines. Programmers use
functions, methods, and objects to organize their code.
This chapter is divided into three sections that introduce*
1. FUNCTIONS 
1. OBJECTS
1. BUILT-IN METHODS
