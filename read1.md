(((((((Markdown))))))))
Markdown formatting codes: A simple markup language, created by John Gruber and contributed by Aaron Swartz,
that allows writing simple text content that is easy to write and read, and then convert it to HTML or XHTML.
It takes many instructions from existing usages that are used to encode plain text in email.
Text formatted with these symbols should be readable as is, without regard to tags and formatting tags,
unlike text formatted in other markup language such as HTML,
which has clear formats and specific formatting instructions. 
Markdown builds legible formatted syntax and can be easily converted to HTML.

Markdown is a Perl script written by Gruber that turns encoded input text into valid HTML or XHTML text.
It can be used as a standalone script or as a plugin for BLUESEXUM or MovableType or as a text filter for BBEdit.
Since then it can be used by others as a software block of Perl available in the comprehensive Perl
network archive and has also been used in a variety of programming languages.
It is distributed under BSD licenses and may be included or available as a plug-in for many content management systems.
