Git is an Open Source Distributed Version Control System.
Now that's a lot of words to define Git. ... Distributed Version Control System: 
Git has a remote repository which is stored in a server and a local repository which is stored in the computer of each developer.

Q- -Why a Version Control System like Git is needed?
Real life projects generally have multiple developers working in parallel. So a version control system like Git is needed to ensure there are no code conflicts between the developers.

Additionally, the requirements in such projects change often. So a version control system allows developers to revert and go back to an older version of the code.

Finally, sometimes several projects which are being run in parallel involve the same codebase. In such a case, the concept of branching in Git is very important.
